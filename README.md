# Oldagram
 Scrimba Essential CSS Project

## Project Description

This was a great CSS refresher project after reviewing the Scrimba Essential CSS module, which covered a lot of CSS troubleshooting.

The figma file for the project can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/xsVZxq50kVtir6zcyozStI/Oldagram-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1&t=Bc0rzLpcU24zjT2E-1

The project scope was simply to replicate the first "post" design and add a hover function to the buttons. However, there are additional goals using Javascript that I am hoping to implement.  

## Next Steps

I want to make this project interactive with JS. The likes will be clickable and increment, and the other posts (currently stored in JS objects) will also appear on the "app".
